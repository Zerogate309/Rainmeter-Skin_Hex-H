# Hex-H
 Rainmeter Skin - Hex H

![Hex H - Screenshot Release](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80350264/121074362-0a049a00-c7d4-11eb-8cf0-9b496d2ee2ac.PNG)

Version 1.1

- Fixed: High CPU-Load – There was a bug in my mind! I made all measures in an external file,
    but EVERY skin load the measure file with ALL measures!
- Fixed: Language setting for date. Now you can choose between 6 different Languages.
    Want other? See inside the “Hex Settings.ini” how to do!
- Fixed: Toggle between C(elsius) and F(ahrenheit) – But the weather doesn’t work!
    See next point…
- Deleted: I removed all weather skins, because Yahoo changed their website at December 2022 
    and the WebParser no longer works.
    The Support have no Time to fix it and said, Yahoo weather is not the best solution.
    And I haven’t the knowledge to fix it by myself. So I delete all weather skins.
    Maybe someday, if there is a stable solution, I bring the skins back…big sorry, for that!
- Update: Links for Programms are now editable! Hover the mouse over the bottom of the skin.
- Added: Top CPU-Process
- Added: 3 Skins for different time zones
- Added: A setup skin for "Apps1" skin (easy edit the Icons & Links)
    (Just put all Icons in the Apps1 folder)
- many, many Bug fixes and improvements!


Hint!

Before you install the new version, save your Hex Variables.ini to a different place!

So you can restore your colors and other settings you have changed!
I have rework ALL skins so ALL must be replaced!

------------
Version 1.0

Here you see my first Rainmeter Skin: The Hexagon H Skin Suite!

("H" means: all Skins can be arranged in Horizontal direction!)

(A "V" Version is coming up soon!)


A year ago I saw the first Rainmeter Skins.
I liked many of them, but nothing really fit. What I found a pity was, that there was always only one skin for one function!
Thats why I started to code my own skin and if possible in different variants. So you have more freedom to decorate the desktop according to your taste.
Also, I made everything modular! Which means, it can be customized very easily and yet centrally.


Skins Includet:
- Audio- Control, Display, Visualisation and Volume
- WebRadio (Streams from Web-Radio-Stations) thx to PInkY77
- Battery, CPU (up to 8 Cores), Power Toys, RAM & Swap, Recycle Bin etc.
- Time and Date in different Versions
- Deco Skins to customize your Desktop
- Drivemonitoring (up to 12 Drives) Single and Multiview
- Link Skins for Folders, Programms and Web-Links
- Network and WLAN Skins
- Some Search Skins


The [NORD Colorpalettes](https://www.nordtheme.com/docs/colors-and-palettes) is includet


I have learned a lot, but there are still many things i don't know and have to do.
So please bear with me, that there are maybe some bugs.

I am very curious what you make great from my skin!


Have fun! Your Zerogate
