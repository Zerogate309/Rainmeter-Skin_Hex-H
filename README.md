![Hex H - Screenshot Release](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80350264/121074362-0a049a00-c7d4-11eb-8cf0-9b496d2ee2ac.PNG)

Here you see my first Rainmeter Skin: The Hexagon H Skin Suite!

("H" means: all Skins can be arranged in Horizontal direction!)

(A "V" Version is coming up soon!)


A year ago I saw the first Rainmeter Skins.
I liked many of them, but nothing really fit. What I found a pity was, that there was always only one skin for one function!
Thats why I started to code my own skin and if possible in different variants. So you have more freedom to decorate the desktop according to your taste.
Also, I made everything modular! Which means, it can be customized very easily and yet centrally.


Skins Includet:
- Audio- Control, Display, Visualisation and Volume
- WebRadio (Streams from Web-Radio-Stations) thx to PInkY77
- Battery, CPU (up to 8 Cores), Power Toys, RAM & Swap, Recycle Bin etc.
- Time and Date in different Versions
- Deco Skins to customize your Desktop
- Drivemonitoring (up to 12 Drives) Single and Multiview
- Link Skins for Folders, Programms and Web-Links
- Network and WLAN Skins
- Some Search Skins


The [NORD Colorpalettes](https://www.nordtheme.com/docs/colors-and-palettes) is includet


I have learned a lot, but there are still many things i don't know and have to do.
So please bear with me, that there are maybe some bugs.

I am very curious what you make great from my skin!


Have fun! Your Zerogate
